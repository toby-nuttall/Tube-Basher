i actaully made it !

this programme takes your start and stop points for london underground stops and returns all the ways to get between them
with 1 or 0 connections

to programme 2 connections would be really hard 

to programme 3 connections would be really, really hard 
i suspect that the number of ways increases massivley with the number of connections
im pretty sure you can probably get just about anywhere off just 1 connection, maybe the odd couple of places will be unreachable with just 1 but i suspect not many 


i could improve this by:
.adding the actual underground data
.limit case testing it
.making a GUI 
.making it into an app and downloading it on my phone
.potentially have it communicate with CSV files so that any graph-map can be solved like this
.maybe one day ill build my own graph maps for all of england and use this code to optimise train journeys
