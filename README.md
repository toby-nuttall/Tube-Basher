# Tube-Basher
using only base python (no packages at all), I was able to build a programme to give potential routes around London on the tube. <br>
This is mostly a proof of concept, for example I haven't botherd to add all the london underground stops and lines, I just left it as ["l1","l2"...], and it could be improved by associating each stop with a path length or wait time or somthing, to try to minimise the time by picking the best route, as it is this programme just picks a route between your desired start and end points. <br>
another improvement I could make would be to embed this in a GUI, maybe in the future...
